		<h3>Moral Views of Market Society <a href="http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/drafts/moral-order.pdf">[pdf]</a>.</h3>
		<p><em>Please do not cite this paper without permission.</em> Co-authored with <a href="http://sociology.berkeley.edu/faculty/fourcade-gourinchas/">Marion Fourcade</a>. Draft of an article to appear in the <em>Annual Review of Sociology</em>.<br /><a href="javascript:Slide('moraldiv').down();">(Show Abstract)</a></p>

			<blockquote>Upon what kind of moral order does capitalism rest? Conversely, does the market give rise to a distinctive set of beliefs, habits, and social bonds? These questions are certainly as old as social science itself. In this review, we evaluate how today’s scholarship approaches the relationship between markets and the moral order. We begin with Hirschman’s characterization of the three rival views of the market as civilizing, destructive, or feeble in its effects on society. We review recent work at the intersection of sociology, economics, and political economy and show that these views persist both as theories of market society and moral arguments about it. We then argue that a fourth view, which we call moralized markets, has become increasingly prominent in economic sociology. This line of research sees markets as cultural phenomena and moral projects in their own right, and seeks to study the mechanisms and techniques by which such projects are realized in practice.</blockquote>

		<div id="ossdiv" style="display:none; overflow:hidden; height:300px;">
			<blockquote>Open Source Software (OSS) is an innovative method of developing software applications that has been very successful over the past eight to ten years. A number of theories have emerged to explain its success, mainly from economics and law. We analyze a very large sample of OSS projects and find striking patterns in the overall structure of the development community. The distribution of projects on a range of activity measures is spectacularly skewed, with only a relatively tiny number of projects showing evidence of the strong collaborative activity which is supposed to characterize OSS. Our findings are consistent with prior, smaller-scale empirical research. We argue that these findings pose problems for the dominant accounts of OSS. We suggest that the gulf between active and inactive projects may be explained by social-structural features of the community which have received little attention in the existing literature. We suggest some hypotheses that might better predict the observed ecology of projects.</blockquote>
